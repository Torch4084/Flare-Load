A basic tool made to help in Web CTF by generating XSS payloads

After downloading the release use `g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -pthread flare-load.cpp -o flare-load` to compile the file
After compiling you can simply use `./flare-load http://domain.test` to use the tool

My first tool, AI helped in it too so please don't make bad comments on it 🙏
