A basic tool made to help in Web CTF by generating XSS payloads

After downloading the release use `g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -pthread flare-load.cpp -o flare-load` to compile the file

After compiling you can simply use `./flare-load http://domain.test --flag-format=Flag{` to use the tool

The repo files doesn't have --flag-format feature, I'm too lazy to add it 🙏, so if you wanna use them you will need to edit the flag format yourself, I was testing in with Flare{} as a flag format so you'll have to find it yourself, sorry for that 

My first tool, AI helped in it too so please don't make bad comments on it 🙏
